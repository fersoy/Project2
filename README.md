# [Today's Quotes]

The purpose of this project is to create a website that will make reminders for husbands or wifes to be able to receive a quote about marriage via maybe(?) calender according to their special days such as the date they met each other, the date they got engaged, the date they got married and etc. and to be able to share these qutoes with each other. They also will be able to add their memorable moments by adding their pictures to this website if they want. We will use calendar api(?) for users to select these important days and we will use data to store quotes and send to the user randomly according to the selected dates.
